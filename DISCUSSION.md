# Major Changes and Improvements

## 1. Added TypeScript Types

Added proper TypeScript interfaces for all API requests and responses. This gives us compile-time error checking instead of runtime failures, better autocomplete in the IDE, and makes the code much more maintainable. The types also serve as documentation for what the API expects and returns.

## 2. Implemented API Pagination

Updated the advocates API to support pagination with configurable page size and limits. This is crucial for performance since the original implementation would try to load all advocates at once, which would break with hundreds of thousands of records. The API now returns paginated results with metadata about total count and navigation, making it scalable and production-ready.

## 3. Fixed Basic Frontend Errors and Bad Practices

Cleaned up the React component to follow best practices and fix TypeScript errors. Added proper event typing, replaced direct DOM manipulation with React state, fixed array search logic for specialties, added missing React keys, renamed functions for quicker understanding, and converted nested promises to async/await. These changes linter errors and make the code more maintainable.

## 4. Added Table Pagination and Reusable Component

Implemented frontend pagination controls with page numbers, previous/next buttons, and result counters. Created a generic PaginationTable component that can be reused throughout the application with any data type. This separates concerns by moving table rendering logic out of the main page component and makes the codebase more modular and maintainable.

## 5. Enhanced Search with Debouncing and Error Handling

Added debounced search functionality that waits 300ms after the user stops typing before filtering results, preventing excessive computations on every keystroke. Implemented proper error handling with user-friendly error messages that appear when API calls fail. Also made search case-insensitive and extracted filter logic into reusable functions for better code organization.

## 6. Implemented Modern UI Design with Tailwind CSS

Transformed the basic HTML table into a modern, professional interface using Tailwind CSS. The overall design is now mobile-responsive and follows modern web design principles, making the application visually appealing and user-friendly.
