# Major Changes and Improvements

## 1. Added TypeScript Types

Added proper TypeScript interfaces for all API requests and responses. This gives us compile-time error checking instead of runtime failures, better autocomplete in the IDE, and makes the code much more maintainable. The types also serve as documentation for what the API expects and returns.

## 2. Implemented API Pagination

Updated the advocates API to support pagination with configurable page size and limits. This is crucial for performance since the original implementation would try to load all advocates at once, which would break with hundreds of thousands of records. The API now returns paginated results with metadata about total count and navigation, making it scalable and production-ready.
